# python-game
Here is where I'm learning how to build my first games in Python >.&lt;


### Objective of repo
The objective is to practice my knowledge of Python by creating simple games that help execise logic
I refactored my code to follow snake_case and utilized python 3 features such as F strings <3

### Resource
"Invent your own computer games" by Al Sweigart

### How to run the games in your terminal
- Clone repo
- `CD` into any of the respective folders for any of the game
- Run `python3 script.py`
- Have Fun

The games are strictly for my learning purposes, not currently taking random code reviews or contributions. 
Feel free to fork the repo and do what you want in your own repo <3
